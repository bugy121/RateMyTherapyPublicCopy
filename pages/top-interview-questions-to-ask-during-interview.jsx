We’ve all been there in an interview–when your potential future employer asks, “What questions do you have?” You don’t want to wing this. It’s essential to be as prepared for this question as all the others because you want to ensure this employer is a great fit
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br><br></br>
You have a great opportunity to really learn about an employer with the right questions. I recommend mixing in questions throughout the interview and saving some questions for the end.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br><br></br>
I have created a list of interview questions to ask an employer that I hope benefits you. There are setting-specific questions at the top and general interview questions at the bottom, which apply to all settings. You do NOT need to ask every question during the interview. I recommend asking a portion of the questions based on what is important to you. I did not include any questions regarding pay and benefits.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br><br></br>
Another resource I wish would have been available to me beginning as a therapist is “Rate My Therapy Company” Facebook group. I created this community to make it easier for therapists to learn about companies before applying. This group allows therapists to rate companies and provide valuable information on factors such as pay, productivity, and company culture.</Box>
